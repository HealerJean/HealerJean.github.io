 * In general, the default implementation of this interface (<code>{@link org.quartz.simpl.SimpleTimeBroker}</code>-

 * lacking in its robustness - especially when Quartz is used in a clustered

 * has a system time that varies by more than a few seconds from the clocks on
 * the other systems in the cluster, scheduling confusion will result.
